The aim of this repo is to provide an API for temtem battle simulation.

ATM there's a script for damage calculation (nuzlocke helper), but it doesn't take traits into account yet.

Requires python >= 3.11, developed on 3.11.3

Note: to run a file in the src folder (say Battle.py) use

```bash
$ py src.Battle
```
